### 29. Five Best Practices

1. Use clear, consistent naming conventions.
2. Keep methods short and focused.
3. Write unit tests for important logic.
4. Avoid magic numbers — use constants.
5. Write comments that explain *why*, not just *what*.

### 30. Code Readability vs. "Smart" Code

Readable code:
- Is easy to understand and modify.
- Uses clear logic and consistent formatting.
- Is preferred over overly clever, cryptic solutions.

> 💡 Clean code is for people. The compiler only cares about correctness.
